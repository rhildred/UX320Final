## Final Exam

<br />
<br />

The actual theme for the final and the marking scheme will be handed out in the exam room. This is some general advice that may help you to get started.

We are using npm/pm2 for process management and we have implemented:

|Command|What it Does|
|---|---|
|start|starts the index.js in the current folder|
|log|continuously displays the log files in the current terminal window. Note* to see the logs type `npm run log` (long story)|
|stop|stops all of the running processes for a fresh `start`|
|test|unimplemented for now|

To get started using wordpress in the current folder start a terminal and type:

1. `npm install` (first time only)
2. `npm stop` to stop any previous instances of Wordpress
3. `npm start` to run the instance of Wordpress in the current folder.

Good luck on the exam and try to have fun!
